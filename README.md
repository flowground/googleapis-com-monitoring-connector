## Authorization

Supported authorization schemes:
- OAuth2

For OAuth 2.0 you need to specify OAuth Client credentials as environment variables in the connector repository:
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - your OAuth client id
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - your OAuth client secret

After per-time series alignment, each time series will contain data points only on the period boundaries. If perSeriesAligner is not specified or equals ALIGN_NONE, then this field is ignored. If perSeriesAligner is specified and does not equal ALIGN_NONE, then this field must be defined; otherwise an error is returned.
* `aggregation.crossSeriesReducer` - _optional_ - The approach to be used to combine time series. Not all reducer functions may be applied to all time series, depending on the metric type and the value type of the original time series. Reduction may change the metric type of value type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If crossSeriesReducer is specified, then perSeriesAligner must be specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE and alignmentPeriod must be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.

If crossSeriesReducer is not defined, this field is ignored.
* `aggregation.perSeriesAligner` - _optional_ - The approach to be used to align individual time series. Not all alignment functions may be applied to all time series, depending on the metric type and value type of the original time series. Alignment may change the metric type or the value type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If crossSeriesReducer is specified, then perSeriesAligner must be specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE and alignmentPeriod must be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.

* `orderBy` - _optional_ - Unsupported: must be left blank. The points in each time series are returned in reverse time order.
* `pageSize` - _optional_ - A positive number that is the maximum number of results to return. If page_size is empty or more than 100,000 results, the effective page_size is 100,000 results. If view is set to FULL, this is the maximum number of Points returned. If view is set to HEADERS, this is the maximum number of TimeSeries returned.
* `pageToken` - _optional_ - If this field is not empty then it must contain the nextPageToken value returned by a previous call to this method. Using this field causes the method to return additional results from the previous method call.
* `view` - _optional_ - Specifies which information is returned about the time series.
    Possible values: FULL, HEADERS.

### Creates or adds data to one or more time series. The response is empty if all time series in the request were written. If any time series could not be written, a corresponding failure message is included in the error response.

*Tags:* `projects`

#### Input Parameters

* `alt` - _optional_ - Data format for response.
    Possible values: json, media, proto.
* `callback` - _optional_ - JSONP
* `fields` - _optional_ - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
* `key` - _optional_ - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.

### Requests a verification code for an already verified channel that can then be used in a call to VerifyNotificationChannel() on a different channel with an equivalent identity in the same or in a different project. This makes it possible to copy a channel between projects without requiring manual reverification of the channel. If the channel is not in the verified state, this method will fail (in other words, this may only be used if the SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode and VerifyNotificationChannel paths have already been used to put the given channel into the verified state).There is no guarantee that the verification codes returned by this method will be of a similar structure or form as the ones that are delivered to the channel via SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode; while VerifyNotificationChannel() will recognize both the codes delivered via SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode() and returned from GetNotificationChannelVerificationCode(), it is typically the case that the verification codes delivered via SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode() will be shorter and also have a shorter expiration (e.g. codes such as "G-123456") whereas GetVerificationCode() will typically return a much longer, websafe base 64 encoded string that has a longer expiration time.

*Tags:* `projects`

#### Input Parameters
* `name` - _required_ - The notification channel for which a verification code is to be generated and retrieved. This must name a channel that is already verified; if the specified channel is not verified, the request will fail.

    Possible values: json, media, proto.
* `callback` - _optional_ - JSONP
